# IIP-Ecosphere platform test artifacts: Implementation classes for generated test streams

Test artifact containing simple implementation classes for test steams generated by the configuration layer, i.e., the [platform configuration component](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/configuration/configuration/README.md).

Please note that this package requires the classes generated from the SimpleMesh test configuration. In turn, the 
SimpleMesh production process uses this artifact as service implementation. For "bootstrapping", just temporarily remove 
the Maven artifact specs from the test configuration, create the interface artifact, build this artifact and 
enable the artifact specs again.
