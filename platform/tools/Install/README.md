# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Install Support

This project contains a dependencies POM to install the basic parts of the platform so that a configuration via [configuration.configuration](../configuration/configuration/README.md) becomes possible as long as there is no UI. Write an IVML configuration file in the style of the tests and run the `PlatformInstantiator`.
